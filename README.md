# Negative Number Operations and Fractions 
### A Study Guide 

## Some basic rules we must agree upon first: 
## *(We will use the * symbol for multiplication)*
1.	A negative number is just a number that has been multiplied by -1.

    **i.e. -a = a * -1**  
    
    **e.g. -2 = 2 * (-1)**

2.	Subtraction is just the *inverse* of addition. 

    **i.e. a - b = a + (-b)**
    
    **e.g. 2 - 1 = 2 +	(-1)**

3.	Division is the *inverse* of multiplication. 

    **i.e. a รท b = a * (1/b)**
    
    **e.g. 1 รท 2 = 1 * (1/2)**
    
4.	Converting division and subtraction equations to multiplication and addition is convenient because multiplication and addition are commutative, meaning the order of terms (numbers) does not matter.

5.	Number lines continue in the positive direction to the right and negative numbers to the left. This means when adding positive numbers, move right. Move left when adding negative numbers.

## Adding Positive Numbers: 
When adding positive numbers, move right on the number line toward the positive end. 

## Adding Negative Numbers: (same as subtraction)
When adding negative numbers, move left on the number line toward the negative end. 

## Subtracting Negative Numbers: 
Remember that subtraction is the inverse of addition. Using the rule outlined in #2 we can see that when we want to subtract a negative number we first invert the operation (subtraction to addition) and the sign (negative or positive) of the following term. 
When we add a negative number, we move toward the negative end of the number line, to the left. 

  **i.e. If we want to find 10 - (-5), first we invert the subtraction symbol to make it an addition problem, and we have to invert the sign of the following term.**
  
  **e.g.**
  
  **10 - (-5) = 10 + (+5) = 15**
  
  **10 - 5 = 10 + (-5) = 15**
